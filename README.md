This project is a smart home security system built using a NodeMCU, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), an LED, and a buzzer. The system detects motion and alerts by lighting up the LED, sounding the buzzer, and sending notifications to Telegram.

How It Works
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to an object. If an object comes within a certain distance, the NodeMCU triggers the LED and buzzer to alert the presence of an object or person, and sends a notification to a predefined Telegram channel.
Setup Instructions
Hardware Setup
Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
Ensure that all connections are secure and correct.
Software Setup
Install the Arduino IDE from here.
Install the NodeMCU board in the Arduino IDE. Follow the instructions here.
Connect the NodeMCU to your computer using a USB cable.
Open the homesecuritybot.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
Upload the code to the NodeMCU.
Usage
Power the NodeMCU with a USB cable or a 5V power source.
The ultrasonic sensor will continuously measure the distance.
If an object is detected within the specified range, the LED will light up, the buzzer will sound, and a notification will be sent to Telegram.
